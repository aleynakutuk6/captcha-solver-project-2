Run the captcha_solver_one_digit.ipynb with the desired fonts you would like to use. You can see the fonts that we have used on fonts.zip. 
Read the readme of the github repository that we are using so that you can understand what constants you have to change in order to modify the blurriness noise and the sice of the single digit captchas.
Notice that the size 80 x 100 size or whatever size you chose must match the size of the captchas that we create in part 1. 
After running captcha_solver_one_digit.ipynb  you will obtain single_digits.zip 
You have to run combine_captchas.py in order combine our single digits in groups of 4.
This is dataset is the new test set.
